= What is it? =

WebEmailProtector is a professional grade web-site email obfuscator (aka EMO) service. Using it on your web-site provides the strongest 
anti-harvesting security available on the web using secure server-side authentication with heuristics. Bona-fide visitors are still 
able to easily contact you via your existing email, seamlessly, but harvesters are stopped in their tracks. This cuts out spammers, virus 
and ID theft perpetrators at source.

Once the plugin is installed, your existing emails registered with WebEmailProtector.com and you complete the simple set-up procedure through the 
settings menu, you can place your email address anywhere on your WordPress site and the rest is taken care of. Each link will then appear to work 
exactly like a regular email link. Any visitor can simply click on your email to seamlessly open their favourite email tool. However with 
our service there is a difference: since your address is no longer contained in the link itself, it is safe from being harvested and misused. 
In-fact we believe that it is so secure that you can do away with cumbersome Contact Forms and Captchas completely.
 
= What does it do? =

The EMO API detects who and what is trying to access the email link on your site, and then uses various mechanisms to determine if 
this request is being made by a bona-fide user. Once a user tries to access your email, your web site automatically contacts 
our server on which a heuristic validation process is run. We then only return your secured email address if certain criteria are met 
and others not broken. It all happens in the blink of an eye and does not noticeably slow down the email experience. And just in case you 
were wondering, we do not see or track the email itself, we only authorise the release of your address so your privacy is protected.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the EMO service? =
Email address harvesters operate by using software "scrapers" or "click through" staff to steal email addresses directly from web-site pages.
Using our EMO (email obfuscator) service prevents this as your email addresses no longer need to be listed directly on your web-site. Instead 
they are hidden behind a security firewall on our server. We then only release the address after 
we are sure it is not being accessed improperly. Because of this it becomes invisible to harvesters and machines and yet is completely 
visible to bona fide users.  

= How does an EMO protected email address appear? =
The EMO protected email address appears on a site like this: " &#60;a href='JavaScript:emo(<yourAPIkey>);' &#62;Any Text &#60;/a &#62;"
(you can change what it says and how it looks)
whereas a non protected email address usually appears like this:" &#60;a href='mailto:nobody@webemailprotector.com' &#62;nobody@webemailprotector.com &#60;/a &#62;". 
Both operate when you "click", but only the EMO one is safe.

= Why is it better than a Contact Form? =
Contact Forms are effective in dealing with both human and machine based harvesting, unless you ever want to use email auto responders of course 
as this gives your identity away.
However the real problem is that all the form filling can annoy and therefore dissuade real users from getting in touch - effectively putting a 
barrier between you and your users in your most important communications channel - email

= Why is it better than Captcha codes? =
Captcha codes are effective in dealing with machines but not with users who simply click to reveal your address.
And the other main issue is that they are very very annoying to real users and can heavily dissuade communications with you - so are effectively 
putting a barrier between you and your wanted users.

= Why is it better than 'free' address encoder? =
Although at first they may appear effective as your 'mailto:' text is no longer obvious to the eye within your HTML code. Encoders and encrypters, 
'free' or otherwise, have to be built so that they can be interpreted by any web-browser using standard HTML. And this is the nature of there 
drawback. 
They are more or less complex but involve a Java/JavaScript sequence munger or character set coder. But to cut a long story short if your browser 
understands them so can any harvesting software. 
So it's actually quite simple for encoded email addresses to be interpreted and harvested using standard software libraries.

= Where do you place the EMO API code? =
Using the plugin a few lines of code are placed in the <head> section of your HTML file.
To use replace any  &#60;a &#62; anchor link email references in the HTML file with the EMO API code.
Again, we send you the code and instructions after sign-up. But it's as simple as that to get protected.

= Do you have to be a web expert to install the EMO API code? =
No, it's designed to be easy to install, and we send you full instructions and offer full support incase of any difficulties.

= How is the email protected? =
We provide protection as the email address is never listed or disclosed on your website. Instead the email address is held in a secure
place on our server and only loaded up when we verify the request is genuine. 

= What do you get for the FREE trial? =
You get the full service free for 6 months, with exactly the same protection as offered with a paid up subscription. 
There is no obligation to purchase, but at the end of the trial we are confident that you will see a reduction in volume of new email 
spam originating from your web site. At the end of the trial we would also ask you to complete a 10 question survey on how you found 
installing and using it.
Please note that as its a trial you only get it once per email/website for you to try unless otherwise agreed with us.

= How do you subscribe following the trial? =
Once your trial is coming to an end we will send you an email detailing what you have to do to continue the services. All
payments can be made on-line using PayPal. the more people that use it the more we can keep prices down.

= How can you check if you are protected? =
Once installed, click on your Email and your installed email tool should open as normal. If you really want to check your email is no longer 
listed view your web site in text mode (e.g. pressing the F12 key in your Internet Explorer/Google Chrome/Firefox web browser) and search for 
your email address or the mailto: reference. It should no longer be there.

== Screenshots ==

2. This is what the same html code looks like '/assets/screenshot-2.png' (the real code has been replaced with ####-####-####-####)
